## How It Works

A random number between 1 and 100 is generated when the game starts.  
You have from 7-15 chances to guess it right.  
After each guess, you'll get feedback to help you decide your next move:

- If your guess is very close to the correct number, you’ll be told so.
- If you're somewhat close, you’ll get a hint.
- If you're far off, the game will let you know whether to go higher or lower.

Once you win or run out of attempts, the game ends. You can start a new game anytime.
