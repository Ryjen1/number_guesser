# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple number guessing game I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It's just for fun â€” you try to guess a secret number between 1 and 100 in **3 tries**.  
Yeah, only 3. No mercy ðŸ˜„

## How it works

There's a hidden number (from 1 to 100).  
You type in your guess, and the game gives you hints:

- ðŸ”¥ If you're really close
- ðŸŽ¯ If you're kinda close
- â¬† or â¬‡ if you're way off

## What I used

- HTML for layout
- CSS for styling (just a bit of color and spacing)
- JS for the logic â€” random numbers, checking guesses, tracking stats
